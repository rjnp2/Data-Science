I use linux system. so i will use libreoffice calc software which is free in cost.

For Analysis,
In the entire first session, i use the hospital charges data set.

let's understand what we're going to accomplish in this session. 

The Hospital Charges dataset has more than 150,000 records of treatment of various ailments in several US hospitals.

Some stats about the dataset:
The dataset has a record of 100 ailments
It has a list of 3000+ healthcare providers (hospitals, medical centres, etc.)
It has data from 50 states of the USA and approximately 2000 cities across the USA
It describes the cost of treatment for approximately 7 million patients

Each record (or row) is a unique combination of state, city, ailment & provider. It also lists the average cost of treatment for a particular ailment.

We are going to analyse this "raw" dataset and prepare a "report" having the list of providers treating a specific ailment in a particular state of USA. Subsequently, we will rank providers by the cost of treatment.

Such a "report" will be extremely useful to government agencies and patients across the state. Instead of analysing the entire dataset, they will now use this report to find the cheapest healthcare provider in their city. Think of this report like a sorted "Yellow Pages" or "Dictionary".
