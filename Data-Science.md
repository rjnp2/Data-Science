# Data-Science: What is, Basics & Process

## What is Data Science?

- Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making.
- Data Science is about finding patterns in data, through analysis, and make future predictions.

In generally, Data Science is the area of study which involves extracting insights from vast amounts of data by the use of various scientific methods, algorithms, and processes. It helps you to discover hidden patterns from the raw data. The term Data Science has emerged because of the evolution of mathematical statistics, data analysis, and big data.

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that allows you to extract knowledge from structured or unstructured data. Data science enables you to translate a business problem into a research project and then translate it back into a practical solution.

In short, we can say that data science is all about:

    • Asking the correct questions and analyzing the raw data.
    • Modeling the data using various complex and efficient algorithms.
    • Visualizing the data to get a better perspective.
    • Understanding the data to make better decisions and finding the final result.

**Example:**
Let suppose we want to travel from station A to station B by car. Now, we need to take some decisions such as which route will be the best route to reach faster at the location, in which route there will be no traffic jam, and which will be cost-effective. All these decision factors will act as input data, and we will get an appropriate answer from these decisions, so this analysis of data is called the data analysis, which is a part of data science.

## Why Data Science?
Here, are significant advantages of using Data Analytics Technology:
1. Data is the oil for today's world. With the right tools, technologies, algoithms, we can use data and convert it into a distinctive business advantage.

The main components of Data Science are given below:

**1. Statistics:** Statistics is one of the most important components of data science. Statistics is a way to collect and analyze the numerical data in a large amount and finding meaningful insights from it.

**2. Domain Expertise:** In data science, domain expertise binds data science together. Domain expertise means specialized knowledge or skills of a particular area. In data science, there are various areas for which we need domain experts.

**3. Data engineering:** Data engineering is a part of data science, which involves acquiring, storing, retrieving, and transforming the data. Data engineering also includes metadata (data about data) to the data.

**4. Visualization:** Data visualization is meant by representing data in a visual context so that people can easily understand the significance of data. Data visualization makes it easy to access the huge amount of data in visuals.

**5. Advanced computing:** Heavy lifting of data science is advanced computing. Advanced computing involves designing, writing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.

**6. Mathematics:** Mathematics is the critical part of data science. Mathematics involves the study of quantity, structure, space, and changes. For a data scientist, knowledge of good mathematics is essential.

**7. Machine learning:** Machine learning is backbone of data science. Machine learning is all about to provide training to a machine so that it can act as a human brain. In data science, we use various machine learning algorithms to solve the problems.

### 1. Discovery:
The first phase is discovery, which involves asking the right questions. Discovery step involves acquiring data from all the identified internal & external sources which helps you to answer the business question.
The data can be:
    • Logs from webservers
    • Data gathered from social media
    • Census datasets
    • Data streamed from online sources using APIs

### 2. Preparation:
Data preparation is also known as Data Munging. Data can have lots of inconsistencies like missing value, blank columns, incorrect data format.
In this phase, we need to perform the following tasks:
    • Data cleaning
    • Data Reduction
    • Data integration
    • Data transformation
After performing all the above tasks, we can easily use this data for our further processes.

### 3. Model Planning:
In this stage, you need to determine the method and technique to draw the relation between input variables. Planning for a model is performed by using different statistical formulas and visualization tools. SQL analysis services, R, and SAS/access are some of the tools used for this purpose.

### 4. Model Building:
In this step, the actual model building process starts. Here, Data scientist distributes datasets for training and testing. Techniques like association, classification, and clustering are applied to the training data set. The model once prepared is tested against the "testing" dataset.

### 5. Operationalize:
In this stage, you deliver the final baselined model with reports, code, and technical documents. Model is deployed into a real-time production environment after thorough testing.

### 6. Communicate Results
In this stage, the key findings are communicated to all stakeholders. This helps you to decide if the results of the project are a success or a failure based on the inputs from the model.
