## 3. String Manipulation 
  Python has long been a popular raw data manipulation language in part due to its ease of use for string and text processing. Most text operations are made simple with the string object’s built-in methods. For more complex pattern matching and text manipulations, regular expressions may be needed. pandas adds to the mix by enabling you to apply string and regular expressions concisely on whole arrays of data, additionally handling the annoyance of missing data.
  
  - **3.1 Regular Expressions** \
    Regular expressions provide a flexible way to search or match (often more complex) string patterns in text. A single expression, commonly called a regex, is a string formed according to the regular expression language. Python’s built-in re module is responsible for applying regular expressions to strings;
    
    The re module functions fall into three categories: 
      - pattern matching
      - substitution
      - splitting
      
 | Argument | Description |
 | --- | --- |
 | findall | Return all non-overlapping matching patterns in a string as a list |
 finditer | Like findall , but returns an iterator
 match | Match pattern at start of string and optionally segment pattern components into groups; if the pattern matches, returns a match object, and otherwise None
 search | Scan string for match to pattern; returning a match object if so; unlike match , the match can be anywhere in the string as opposed to only at the beginning
 split | Break string into pieces at each occurrence of pattern
 sub, subn | Replace all ( sub ) or first n occurrences ( subn ) of pattern in string with replacement expression; use symbols \1, \2, ... to refer to match group elements in the replacement string
