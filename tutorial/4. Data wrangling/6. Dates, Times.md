# 6. Time Series
Time series data is an important form of structured data in many different fields, such as finance, economics, ecology, neuroscience, and physics. 

pandas is generally oriented toward working with arrays of dates, whether used as an axis index or a column in a DataFrame. The to_datetime method parses many different kinds of date representations.

  - **6.1 Indexing, Selection, Subsetting** \
    Time series behaves like any other pandas.Series when you are indexing and selecting data based on label. \
    For longer time series, a year or only a year and month can be passed to easily select slices of data.

  - **6.2 Time Series with Duplicate Indices** \
    In some applications, there may be multiple data observations falling on a particular timestamp.

  - **6.2 Date Ranges, Frequencies, and Shifting** \
    Generic time series in pandas are assumed to be irregular; that is, they have no fixed frequency. For many applications this is sufficient. However, itâ€™s often desirable to work relative to a fixed frequency, such as daily, monthly, or every 15 minutes, even if that means introducing missing values into a time series. Fortunately pandas has a full suite of standard time series frequencies and tools for resampling, inferring frequencies, and generating fixed-frequency date ranges.
    - **6.2.1 Generating Date Ranges** 
      ```python
      pandas.date_range(start=None, end=None, periods=None, freq=None, normalize=False)
      ```
      Freq has many options including:
      
      | freq | descriptions |
      | --- | --- |
      B | Business Day
      D | Calender day
      W | Weekly
      M | Monthly
      Q | Quarterly
      A | Annual
      H | Hourly
      
Important Functions:
___
| function | Description |
| --- | --- |
ts.resample() | Resample data with new frequency.
ts.ix[start:end] |  Return data for nearest time interval. 
ts[] | Return data for specific time.
ts.between_time() | Return data between specific interval.
to_pydatetime() | Convert Pandas DatetimeIndex to datetime.datetime object
to_datetime() | Conver a list of date-like objects (strings, epochs, etc.) to a DatetimeIndex.
