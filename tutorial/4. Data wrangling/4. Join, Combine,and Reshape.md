# 4. Join, Combine, and Reshape
  In many applications, data may be spread across a number of files or databases or be arranged in a form that is not easy to analyze.
  
  - **4.1 Hierarchical Indexing** \
    Hierarchical indexing is an important feature of pandas that enables you to have multiple (two or more) index levels on an axis.

    Hierarchical indexing plays an important role in reshaping data and group-based operations like forming a pivot table. Rearrange the data into a DataFrame using its **unstack method** and inverse operation of unstack is **stack**:

   - **4.2 Combining and Merging Datasets** \
    Data contained in pandas objects can be combined together in a number of ways:
    
      - pandas.merge connects rows in DataFrames based on one or more keys. This ill be familiar to users of SQL or other relational databases, as it implements
      database join operations.
      
      ```python
      DataFrame.merge(dataframe1, dataframe2, how='inner', on=key_col, left_on=left_key_col, right_on=right_key_col)
      #On option = If the column names are same in each object
      #left_on ,right_on = If the column names are different in each object, can specify them separately:
      ```
      - pandas.concat concatenates or “stacks” together objects along an axis.
              
        ```python
        pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)
        ```
   - **4.3 Reshaping and Pivoting** \
      - **4.3.1 Reshaping with Hierarchical Indexing** \
          Hierarchical indexing provides a consistent way to rearrange data in a DataFrame.
          There are two primary actions:
          
          stack : This “rotates” or pivots from the columns in the data to the rows \
          unstack : This pivots from the rows into the columns
       
      - **4.3.2 Pivoting “Long” to “Wide” Format** \
          A common way to store multiple time series in databases and CSV is in so-called long or stacked format. \

      - **Pivoting “Wide” to “Long” Format** \
          An inverse operation to pivot for DataFrames is pandas.melt . Rather than transforming one column into many in a new DataFrame, it merges multiple columns into one, producing a DataFrame that is longer than the input. \
