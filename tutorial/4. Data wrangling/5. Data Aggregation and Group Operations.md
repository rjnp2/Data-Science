# 5. Data Aggregation and Group Operations
  Categorizing a dataset and applying a function to each group, whether an aggregation or transformation, is often a critical component of a data analysis workflow. After loading, merging, and preparing a dataset, you may need to compute group statistics or possibly pivot tables for reporting or visualization purposes. pandas provides a flexible groupby interface, enabling you to slice, dice, and summarize datasets in a natural way. \
  The expressiveness of Python and pandas, we can perform quite complex group operations by utilizing any function that accepts a pandas object or NumPy array. They are  
  ___
  - Split a pandas object into pieces using one or more keys (in the form of functions, arrays, or DataFrame column names)
  - Calculate group summary statistics, like count, mean, or standard deviation, or a user-defined function
  - Apply within-group transformations or other manipulations, like normalization,linear regression, rank, or subset selection
  - Compute pivot tables and cross-tabulations
  - Perform quantile analysis and other statistical group analyses

    - **5.1.1  Iterating Over Groups** \
        The GroupBy object supports iteration, generating a sequence of 2-tuples containing the group name along with the chunk of data. \

- **5.2 Data Aggregation** \
  Aggregations refer to any data transformation that produces scalar values from arrays. The preceding examples have used several of them, including mean , count ,min , and sum. \
  | Function name | Description |
  | --- | --- |
   count |  Number of non-NA values in the group
   sum  |  Sum of non-NA values
   mean | Mean of non-NA values
   median | Arithmetic median of non-NA values
   std, var | Unbiased (n â€“ 1 denominator) standard deviation and variance
   min, max | Minimum and maximum of non-NA values
   prod | Product of non-NA values
   first, last | First and last non-NA values 
  
- **5.3 Pivot Tables and Cross-Tabulation** \
  A pivot table is a data summarization tool frequently found in spreadsheet programs and other data analysis software. It aggregates a table of data by one or more keys, arranging the data in a rectangle with some of the group keys along the rows and some along the columns.
  DataFrame has a pivot_table method, and there is also a top-level pandas.pivot_table function. In addition to providing a convenience interface to groupby , pivot_table can add partial totals, also known as margins.
  
  ```python
     pandas.pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean',
     fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All')
  ```
  | Function name | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  values | Column name or names to aggregate; by default aggregates all numeric columns
  index | Column names or other group keys to group on the rows of the resulting pivot table
  columns | Column names or other group keys to group on the columns of the resulting pivot table
  aggfunc | Aggregation function or list of functions ( 'mean' by default); can be any function valid in a groupby context
  dropna |  If True , do not include columns whose entries are all NA
  fill_value | Replace missing values in result table
  margins | Add row/column subtotals and grand total ( False by default)

  - **Cross-Tabulations: Crosstab** \
    A cross-tabulation (or crosstab for short) is a special case of a pivot table that computes group frequencies. \
