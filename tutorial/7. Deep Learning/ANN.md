# Neural Networks

Neural Network or artificial neural network (ANN) are modeled the same as the human brain. \
The neural network is made up many perceptrons. Perceptron is a single layer neural network. It is a binary classifier and part of supervised learning. A simple model of the biological neuron in an artificial neural network is known as the perceptron.

The artificial neuron has input and output. \

Human brain has neurons for passing information, similarly neural network has nodes to perform the same task. Nodes are the mathematical functions.

A neural network is based on the structure and function of biological neural networks. A neural network itself changes or learn based on input and output. The information flows through the system affect the structure of the artificial neural network because of its learning and improving the property.

Neural networks are modeled in accordance with the human brain so as to imitate their functionality. The human brain can be defined as a neural network that is made up of several neurons, so is the Artificial Neural Network is made of numerous perceptron. \

A neural network comprises of three main layers, which are as follows;

- Input layer: \
  The input layer accepts all the inputs that are provided by the programmer.
- Hidden layer: \
  In between the input and output layer, there is a set of hidden layers on which computations are performed that further results in the output.
- Output layer: \
  After the input layer undergoes a series of transformations while passing through the hidden layer, it results in output that is delivered by the output layer.

## What are Artificial Neural Networks?
Artificial Neural Networks are the computing system that is designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes the information. Artificial Neural Networks have self-learning capabilities that enable it to produce a better result as more data become available. So, if the network is trained on more data, it will be more accurate because these neural networks learn from the examples. The neural network can be configured for specific applications like data classification, pattern recognition, etc.

With the help of the neural network, we can actually see that a lot of technology has been evolved from translating webpages to other languages to having a virtual assistant to order groceries online. All of these things are possible because of neural networks. So, an artificial neural network is nothing but a network of various artificial neurons.
