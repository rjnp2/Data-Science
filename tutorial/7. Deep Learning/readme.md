# Deep Learning Tutorial
Deep learning is based on the branch of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. Since neural networks imitate the human brain and so deep learning will do. In deep learning, nothing is programmed explicitly. Basically, it is a machine learning class that makes use of numerous nonlinear processing units so as to perform feature extraction as well as transformation. The output from each preceding layer is taken as input by each one of the successive layers.

Deep learning models are capable enough to focus on the accurate features themselves by requiring a little guidance from the programmer and are very helpful in solving out the problem of dimensionality. Deep learning algorithms are used, especially when we have a huge no of inputs and outputs.

## Working of Deep Learning

In deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for a good reason. A computer model learns to perform the classification tasks directly from any images, text, and sound in deep learning.

The term "deep" commonly refers to the number of hidden layer in the neural network. Conventional neural networks only contain 2-3 hidden layers, while deep networks can have 150. \

## Types of Deep Learning Networks
1. [Feed Forward Neural Network](https://github.com/rjnp2/Data-Science/blob/main/tutorial/7.%20Deep%20Learning/ANN.md)

2. [Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/rjnp2/Data-Science/tree/main/tutorial/7.%20Deep%20Learning/RNN)
    
3. [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/rjnp2/Data-Science/blob/main/tutorial/7.%20Deep%20Learning/CNN.md) 

4. Restricted Boltzmann Machine \
  RBMs are yet another variant of Boltzmann Machines. Here the neurons present in the input layer and the hidden layer encompasses symmetric connections amid them. However, there is no internal association within the respective layer. But in contrast to RBM, Boltzmann machines do encompass internal connections inside the hidden layer. These restrictions in BMs helps the model to train efficiently. \
  Applications:
    - Filtering.
    - Feature Learning.
    - Classification.
    - Risk Detection.
    - Business and Economic analysis.

5. Autoencoders \
  An autoencoder neural network is another kind of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Here the number of hidden cells is merely small than that of the input cells. But the number of input cells is equivalent to the number of output cells. An autoencoder network is trained to display the output similar to the fed input to force AEs to find common patterns and generalize the data. The autoencoders are mainly used for the smaller representation of the input. It helps in the reconstruction of the original data from compressed data. This algorithm is comparatively simple as it only necessitates the output identical to the input.
    - Encoder: Convert input data in lower dimensions.
    - Decoder: Reconstruct the compressed data.
  Applications:
    - Classification.
    - Clustering.
    - Feature Compression.

## Deep learning applications
- Self-Driving Cars \
In self-driven cars, it is able to capture the images around it by processing a huge amount of data, and then it will decide which actions should be incorporated to take a left or right or should it stop. So, accordingly, it will decide what actions it should take, which will further reduce the accidents that happen every year.
- Voice Controlled Assistance \
When we talk about voice control assistance, then Siri is the one thing that comes into our mind. So, you can tell Siri whatever you want it to do it for you, and it will search it for you and display it for you.
- Automatic Image Caption Generation \
Whatever image that you upload, the algorithm will work in such a way that it will generate caption accordingly. If you say blue colored eye, it will display a blue-colored eye with a caption at the bottom of the image.
- Automatic Machine Translation \
With the help of automatic machine translation, we are able to convert one language into another with the help of deep learning.
