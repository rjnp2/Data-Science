## Introduction to Python SQL Libraries
All software applications interact with data, most commonly through a database management system (DBMS). Some programming languages come with modules that you can use to interact with a DBMS, while others require the use of third-party packages. In this, explore the different Python SQL libraries that you can use. You’ll develop a straightforward application to interact with SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases.

In this, we will learn how to:

    • Connect to different database management systems with Python SQL libraries
    • Interact with SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases
    • Perform common database queries using a Python application
    • Develop applications across different databases using a Python script
