# 4. Matrices and Vectors
A matrix is an array of numbers, symbols or expressions, made up of rows and columns. A matrix is characterized by the amount of rows, m, and the amount of columns, n, it has. 

  ##### Order of a Matrix : 
    The order of a matrix is defined in terms of its number of rows and columns. 
    Order of a matrix = No. of rows ×No. of columns , ‘m x n’ (read: “m by n”).
    
Below, we display an example 2 x 3 matrix A:

We can refer to individual elements of the matrix through its corresponding row and column. For example, A[1, 2] = 2, since in the first row and second column the number 2 is placed.

A matrix with only a single column is called a vector. For example, every column of the matrix A above is a vector. Let us take the first column of the matrix A as the vector v:

## Matrix Operations
Our ability to analyze and solve particular problems within the field of linear algebra will be greatly enhanced when we can perform algebraic operations with matrices. Here, the most important basic tools for performing these operations are listed.

### (i) Matrix Sums
If A and B are m x n matrices, then the sum A+B is the m x n matrix whose columns are the sums of the corresponding columns in A and B. The sum A+B is defined only when A and B are the same size.

Of course, subtraction of the matrices, A-B, works in the same way, where the columns in B are subtracted from the columns in A.

### (ii) Scalar Multiples
If r is a scalar, then the scalar multiple of the matrix A is r*A, which is the matrix whose columns are r times the corresponding columns in A.

### (iii) Matrix-Vector Multiplication
If the matrix A is of size m x n (thus, it has n columns), and u is a vector of size n, then the product of A and u, denoted by Au, is the linear combination of the columns of A using the corresponding entries in u as weights.

### (iv) Matrix Multiplication
If A is an m x n matrix and B = [b1, b2, …, bp] is an n x p matrix where bi is the i-th column of the matrix B, then the matrix product AB is the m x p matrix whose columns are Ab1, Ab2, …, Abp. So, essentially, we perform the same procedure as in (iii) with matrix-vector multiplication, where each column of the matrix B is a vector.

#### Properties of Matrix addition and multiplication: 
    1. A+B = B+A (Commutative)
    2. (A+B)+C = A+ (B+C) (Associative)
    3. AB ? BA (Not Commutative)
    4. (AB) C = A (BC) (Associative)
    5. A (B+C) = AB+AC (Distributive)

### (v) Powers of a Matrix
If A is an n x n matrix and k is a positive integer, then A^k (A to the power k) is the product of k copies of A:

### (vi) Matrix Transpose
Suppose we have a matrix A of size m x n, then the transpose of A (denoted by A^T) is the n x m matrix whose columns are formed from the corresponding rows of A.
if A= [aij] mxn , then AT = [bij] nxm where bij = aji.

### Properties of transpose of a matrix:

## (vii) Adjoint of a square matrix:
The adjoint of a matrix A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix of A

### Cofactor
A cofactor is the number you get when you remove the column and row of a designated element in a matrix, which is just a numerical grid in the form of a rectangle or a square. The cofactor is always preceded by a positive (+) or negative (-) sign, depending whether the element is in a + or - position.

### Determinant matrix
The determinant is defined as a scalar value which is associated with the square matrix. If X is a matrix, then the determinant of a matrix is represented by |X| or det (X).
Let us assume a 2×2 square matrix

Finding Determinants for 3×3 Matrix
Now, assume the 3×3 matrix, say

## (vii) Matrix Inverse
Inverse of a matrix is defined usually for square matrices. For every m × n square matrix, there exists an inverse matrix. If A is the square matrix then A-1 is the inverse of matrix A and satisfies the property:

	AA-1 = A-1A = I, where I is the Identity matrix.
Also, the determinant of the square matrix here should not be equal to zero.

## Matrix Decomposition
- A matrix decomposition is a way of reducing a matrix into its constituent parts.
- It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself.
- A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 10 into 2 x 5. For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called **matrix factorization**. Like factoring real values, there are many ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of different matrix decomposition techniques.
- Two simple and widely used matrix decomposition methods are the LU matrix decomposition and the QR matrix decomposition.
   
1. **LU Decomposition**
	L U decomposition of a matrix is the factorization of a given square matrix into two triangular matrices, one upper triangular matrix and one lower triangular matrix, such that the product of these two matrices gives the original matrix. \
	A square matrix A can be decomposed into two square matrices L and U such that A = L U where U is an upper triangular matrix formed as a result of applying Gauss Elimination Method on A; and L is a lower triangular matrix with diagonal elements being equal to 1. \
	For A = ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58425689/106712190-b533f580-6620-11eb-8cf9-76057fc671da.png), 

	we have L = ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58425689/106712226-c1b84e00-6620-11eb-8f6f-68fcbec70c03.png)
	 and U = ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58425689/106712239-c54bd500-6620-11eb-9d5a-76fb20d3bc81.png);

	 such that A = L U. \

- **QR Decomposition/Factorization**
	QR decomposition, also known as QR factorization, is a method used when converting a matrix into the form A = QR. In the formula, A represents the starting matrix, Q represents an orthogonal matrix, and R represents an upper triangle matrix. An upper triangle matrix is a special kind of square matrix in which all of the entries below the main diagonal are zero. Often, QR decomposition is used in solving the linear least squares problem.
	
	- **QR Decomposition and Machine Learning**
	QR decomposition can be useful in machine learning applications. An example of using QR decomposition in machine learning is the automatic removal of an object from an image.
