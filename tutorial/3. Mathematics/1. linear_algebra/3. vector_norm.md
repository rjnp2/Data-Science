## Vector Norms
Vector norms measure the magnitude of a vector. Fundamentally, the size of a given variable x can be represented by its norm ||x||, and the norm represents the distance between two variables x and y, and it is represented by ||x-y||.\
The general equation of the vector norm: \

These are the general classes of p-norms:

   - **L1 norm or Manhattan Norm.**
   The L1 norm on R^n is defined for x ∈ R^n as shown in figure: \

   ```python
   # l1 norm of a vector
   from numpy import array
   from numpy.linalg import norm
   
   a = array([1, 2, 3])
   print(a)
   
   l1 = norm(a, 1)
   print(l1)
   
   Result: 
	[1 2 3]
	6.0
   ```

   - **L2 norm or Euclidean Norm.**
   The L2 norm of x∈R^n is defined as: \

     ```python
	# l2 norm of a vector
	from numpy import array
	from numpy.linalg import norm
	a = array([1, 2, 3])
	print(a)
	l2 = norm(a)
	print(l2)
     ```	

# L1 and L2 norms are used in Regularization.
