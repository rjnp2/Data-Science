# The Mathematics of Machine Learning

Machine Learning theory is a field that intersects statistical, probabilistic, computer science and algorithmic aspects arising from learning iteratively from data and finding hidden insights which can be used to build intelligent applications.

## 1. Linear Algebra:
  - Topics such as **Vectors_Spaces and Norms,Matrices and it's Decomposition,Orthogonalization & Orthonormalization, Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).** 
  
## 2. Probability Theory and Statistics: 
  - Machine Learning and Statistics aren’t very different fields.
  - Some of the fundamental Statistical and Probability Theory needed for ML are 
      
      - **Counting Techniques**
      
      - **Probability Rules & Axioms, Bayes’ Theorem, Random Variables,Variance and Expectation Conditional and Joint Distributions, Standard Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial, Uniform and Gaussian**
      - **Statistics - Descriptive & Inferential**
      - **Moment Generating Functions, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Prior and Posterior, Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP).**

## 3. Multivariate Calculus: 
  - Some of the necessary topics include 
    
      - **Differential and Integral Calculus, Partial Derivatives, Vector-Values Functions, Directional Gradient** 
      
      - **Hessian, Jacobian, Laplacian and Lagragian Distribution.**
  
## 4. Algorithms and Complex Optimizations: 
  - This is important for understanding the computational efficiency and scalability of our Machine Learning Algorithm and for exploiting sparsity in our            datasets.
  - Knowledge of
  
      - **data structures (Binary Trees, Hashing, Heap, Stack etc),Randomized & Sublinear Algorithm, Graphs, Gradient/Stochastic Descents and Primal-Dual methods**

## 5. Others: 
  - This comprises of other Math topics not covered in the four major areas described above. 
  - They include 
  
      - **Real and Complex Analysis (Sets and Sequences, Topology, Metric Spaces, Cauchy Kernel, Fourier Transforms)** 
      
      - **Information Theory (Entropy, Information Gain)** 
      - **Function Spaces and Manifolds.**
