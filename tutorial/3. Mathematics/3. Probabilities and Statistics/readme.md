   - Percentile \
    The percent of the population which lies below that value. The data must be ranked to find percentiles. \
    The kth percentile is the number which has k% of the values below it. The data must be ranked. \
        1. Rank the data
        2. Find k% (k /100) of the sample size, n.
        3. If this is an integer, add 0.5. If it isn't an integer round up.
        4. Find the number in this position. If your depth ends in 0.5, then take the midpoint between the two numbers. \
    It is sometimes easier to count from the high end rather than counting from the low end. For example, the 80thÂ percentile is the number which has 80% below it       and 20% above it. Rather than counting 80% from the bottom, count 20% from the top. \
