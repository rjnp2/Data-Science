# Estimation

## Definitions

- **Estimation** \
    Estimation statistics is a data analysis framework that uses a combination of effect sizes, confidence intervals, precision planning, and meta-analysis to plan experiments, analyze data and interpret results. It is distinct from null hypothesis significance testing, which is considered to be less informative. \
    Data from the sample are then used to develop estimates of the characteristics of the larger population. The process of using a sample to make inferences about a population is called **statistical inference**. 
    
    **Characteristics** such as 
    - **the population mean, the population variance, and the population proportion are called parameters of the population.** 
    - **the sample such as the sample mean, the sample variance, and the sample proportion are called sample statistics.** 

    ## There are two types of estimates: point and interval. 
    - **A point estimate** is a value of a sample statistic that is used as a single estimate of a population parameter. No statements are made about the quality or precision of a point estimate.
    - **A interval estimates** are accompanied by a statement concerning the degree of confidence that the interval contains the population parameter being estimated. Interval estimates of population parameters are called confidence intervals.

- **Confidence Interval** \
An interval estimate with a specific level of confidence

- **Confidence Level** \
The percent of the time the true mean will lie in the interval estimate given.

- **Consistent Estimator** \
An estimator which gets closer to the value of the parameter as the sample size increases.

- **Degrees of Freedom** \
The number of data values which are allowed to vary once a statistic has been determined.

- **Estimator** \
A sample statistic which is used to estimate a population parameter. It must be unbiased, consistent, and relatively efficient.

- **Interval Estimate** \
A range of values used to estimate a parameter.

- **Maximum Error of the Estimate** \
The maximum difference between the point estimate and the actual parameter. The Maximum Error of the Estimate is 0.5 the width of the confidence interval for means and proportions.

- **Point Estimate** \
A single value used to estimate a parameter.

- **Relatively Efficient Estimator** \
The estimator for a parameter with the smallest variance.

- **T distribution** \
A distribution used when the population variance is unknown.

- **Unbiased Estimator** \
An estimator whose expected value is the mean of the parameter being estimated.
